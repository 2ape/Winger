00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
- In the last video,

2
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.660
I talked all about the window object

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.680
and how you can pretty much
just ignore it completely.

4
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.520
And in this video,

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.220
we wanna talk about the document object,

6
00:00:07.220 --> 00:01:01.493
which is incredibly useful
all across programming
in the browser.
So to see exactly what
this document object is,
let's just console.log out document,
and we just type in document.
This is exactly the same as
if we typed window.document.
They're both the same thing we
can just use document though,
or window.document it's going
to print the same thing.
As you can see,
it prints out this weird
like hashtag document.
And when we open this up,
you're gonna see document
is essentially just all
of the html for our page.
You can see this is the exact HTML
of our entire page from
this index.html here.
So it's printing out the HML of our page
and that's really useful
because the document
allows us to get elements
from our HTML.
It allows us to modify our HTML,
create new elements to add into our HTML.
It's really the way you interact
with the HTML of your page.
So for example, if we wanna get the body,
we could say document.body,
and this is going to give us
that body element of our document.
We could also get for
example, document element,

8
00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:06.925
and this is going to give
us just the HTML portion
of our document.

9
00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:12.586
You can notice when we
had just document here,
it also gave us this doc type at the top,

10
00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:18.774
but if we just wanna get the HTML element
and everything inside of it,
that's what document
element is used for it.

11
00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:23.730
Now, I also mentioned that
you can create elements
with document.create element.

12
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.101
So let's just come in here
and we're gonna create a new element
and we're gonna set it equal
to document.create element.

13
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:30.410
And this is a function.

14
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.777
And all you do is pass
the name of the tag.
So you can create, for example, a div

15
00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:35.738
or you can create a span,
whatever you want to create.

16
00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:39.862
We'll just create a
span here, for example.
And then we can take our element.

17
00:01:39.862 --> 00:01:43.569
And if we wanna put some
text inside of this,
we'll say dot innertext,

18
00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.363
'cause now we have access to an element
and to specify the
texts we say, innertext,

19
00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:50.570
and we'll just set it
equal to Hello World.

20
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.140
And now we just wanna add
that to our document body.

21
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.489
So we can say document.body,

22
00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.330
'cause this is where
we're gonna add this too.

23
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.880
We could say dot appendchild

24
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.397
and we pass in the element we want to add,
which in our case is this
element we just created.

25
00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:07.480
We're going to append it
to the end of the body
of our document.

26
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.312
We click save.

27
00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:11.410
You'll notice nothing gets printed out,
but if I pull over the page,

28
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.930
you'll see that Hello
World has been appended
to the end of our document.

29
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.930
If I just shrink this down,
so it's on the right side of our screen.

30
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.523
And I changed this to like,
Hello World 2 and save.
You can now see it reruns
and re-adds this element
with the text, Hello World 2.

31
00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:29.660
So this document is super powerful
and is really the gateway into interacting
with everything inside of our browser,

32
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.582
creating elements, selecting elements,
adding events, modifying things,
it's all done through
this document object here.

33
00:02:35.582 --> 00:02:41.824
And in the next few videos,
I'm gonna explore all the different ways
you can use this document
object in more depth,
but this video was really just a precursor

34
00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:46.870
to what the document object is
and how you can use it to
just create a simple element.

35
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.220
So in the next video,
I'm gonna show you how you
can select elements using
their ID and their class
with this document object.

36
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.320
And I can't wait to see you in that video.
